        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Easton and I was born in Pennsylvania. I went to school at Penn State University where I studied Economics. I have always had an interest in money and finance, so I suppose that is why I was drawn to the subject. Within the subject, there were a lot of concepts/theories that kept me interested, and I liked the balance between Micro and Macroeconomics. The most intriguing subject to me was the Federal Reserve System and how it interacts with the economy. It was also fun to have semester-long competitions on who could make the biggest gains in the stock market with fake money. Apparently, all you had to do to win was short TSLA before Elon Musk went on Joe Rogan's podcast and smoked with him.

            In one of my earlier semesters, I took an introductory class in Computer Science and wrote my first line of code. We were learning Python, which is a very good language for beginners, but it was still quite foreign to me. Also, it seemed that most students in the class had experience writing code. This is how I discovered the wealth of free information about technology on the internet. Since I wanted to get up to speed with other students in the class, I spent a lot of time on various sites (thank you StackOverflow) and YouTube videos to teach myself the lessons. To me, this was a new way to learn, and I was having fun doing it. I stayed with Economics as my major because I felt I got a better value for my money with the professors/lectures than I did with Computer Science.

            While I was in school, I picked up a job at a local retail store. As a sales associates, one of my main responsibilities was to restock the sales floor. We used a reporting software that came with our POS system for this. These reports worked, but were far from perfect. They had a bunch of extra information and duplicates, and were not in the order of the warehouse. To me, this seemed like an obvious way to make a small increase in efficiency in each restock, which would add up over time, I just had no idea how to do it. So, I learned how databases worked and how to query them. I came back after a week with a basic understanding of SQL, and made my own version of the report. After I showed it to a manager, we decided to use the new version I had created for all the restock reports.

            Over my three years at the store, this type of reinvention became more common. I ended up learning Visual Basic to automate our employee schedule that was made in Excel each week. Combining VBA with SQL, I created several reports using Microsoft Access that were used daily by various departments. This is where I got my first experience designing a UI, and I knew I liked it right away. Putting a button on a page and writing code to make it do something allowed me to be creative and build things from scratch. At the time I left, I had held a Business Analyst role for over a year, after starting as a sales associate.

            After I graduated college, I moved to Dallas where I began my current job as a Technical Operations Analyst. One of the major things this job has taught me is the process of developing and deploying software in a professional and collaborative environment. In my previous experience, I was focused on getting the code to work and didn't have any consideration for version control or proper infrastructure. In my current role, I work primarily in a Linux environment, writing code in Perl and Bash. I also perform database research and updates based on tickets for external clients as well as perform daily operational tasks. Recently, I have gained experience and knowledge in our various deployment and monitoring tools, including AWS, Jenkins, Jira, etc.

            Below are skills/software that I have at least working knowledge and several months of experience with, either personally or professionally.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML (personal)</li>
            <li>CSS (personal)</li>
            <li>JavaScript (both)</li>
            <li>React (personal)</li>
            <li>Python (both)</li>
            <li>Perl (professional)</li>
            <li>Bash (professional)</li>
            <li>SQL (both)</li>

            <li>Git (both)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Some skills, like Python, I have been using for years, while React is relatively new to me. I made this website to learn and improve my front-end skills. Besides technology, my other interests include playing/watching <a href="projects/woj.html" target="_blank">basketball</a>, <a href="https://main.d1e7vuti9ychex.amplifyapp.com/" target="_blank">sneakers</a>, and video games. I will be adding to the projects page on the site as I work on various side projects that interest me. Thanks for reading!
