        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Easton and I was born in Pennsylvania. I went to school at Penn State University where I studied Economics. I have always had an interest in money and finance, so I was drawn to the subject after one introductory class. A lot of the concepts made sense to me, and I liked the balance between Micro and Macroeconomics, so I enjoyed studying the subject during my time at school. In one of my earlier semesters, I took an introductory class in Computer Science and wrote my first line of code. We were learning Python, which is a very good language for beginners, but it was quite foreign to me. Also, it seemed that most students in the class had experience writing code. This is how I discovered the wealth of free information about technology on the internet. Since I wanted to get up to speed with other students in the class, I spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow and other resources to teach myself the lessons. To me, this was once of the key differences between Computer Science and other subjects. While I definitely could learn Economic subjects on my own through online lectures, books, and research papers, with Computer Science, I could start building things on my own pretty quickly without any formal education. I decided that I would continue studying Economics in school and learn Computer Science on my own time.

            While I was in school, I picked up a job at a local retail store. One of my main responsibilities as a sales associate was to restock products that sold. We used reports that came with our POS software. These reports were very clunky and inefficient. They contained a lot of empty whitespace, extra information, duplicate products, and were not in order of how our warehouse was organized. To me, this seemed like an obvious way to make a small increase in efficiency in each restock, which would add up over time. The only problem was, I had no idea how this report was being created or how the data was being stored. So, I learned how databases worked and how to query them. I came back after a week, and made my own version of the restock report. After I showed it to a manager, we decided to use the new version I had created for all the restock reports. Over my three years at the store, this type of reinvention became more common. I ended up learning Visual Basic to automate our employee schedule. Combining that skill with SQL, I created several reports using Microsoft Access that were used daily by various departments. Since we had very limited access to our database, I used Python and SQL to create a database that I had control over the data types, relationships, tables, etc. I was able to increase the speed and accuracy of reports I had created. By the time I left, I held a Business Analyst role, after starting as a sales associate.

            After I graduated college, I moved to Dallas where I began my current job as a Technical Operations Analyst. One of the major things this job has taught me is the process of developing and deploying software in a professional and collaborative environment. In my previous experience, I was focused on getting the code to work and didn't have any consideration for version control or proper infrastructure. In my current job, I work primarily in a Linux environment, writing code in Perl and Bash. I also perform database research and updates based on tickets for external clients as well as work on daily operational tasks. Recently, I have gained experience in our monitoring tools, including AWS, Jenkins, Jira, etc. Below are the skills I have experience with either professionally, personally or both:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML (personal)</li>
            <li>CSS (personal)</li>
            <li>JavaScript (both)</li>
            <li>jQuery (personal)</li>
            <li>React (personal)</li>
            <li>Python (both)</li>
            <li>Perl (professional)</li>
            <li>Bash (professional)</li>
            <li>SQL (both)</li>
            <li>AWS (both)</li>
            <li>Git (both)</li>
        </ul>

            I made this website to learn and improve my web design skills. Besides technology, my other interests include playing/watching basketball, video games, and sneakers. I will be adding to the projects page on the site as I work on various side projects that interest me. Thanks for reading!
